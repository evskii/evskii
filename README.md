## Welcome to my GitHub x
My name is Evan Williams and I am currently attending Technological University Dublin (TUD) as a third year games design student. My main focus is creating and learning effective backend solutions in games as well as making the buttons go brrr. If you ever want to ask questions or offer some advice you can contact me on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_evskii).


If you want to try out some of my games you can check out my [Itch.io](https://evskii.itch.io/), and if you want the source code send me a message and I can post it here.
